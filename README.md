# dl-site-scrubber
Project intended to make QOL scripts to scrub a list of file-hosting sites downloading pages to make life simpler. 

SiteScrubber is specifically made for various download sites that have you wait a certain amount of time, or click a button that is buried behind invisible blocks that intercept your click and take you to a different site. These scripts will help remove all the clutter and make the page simple to navigate and complete to download your requested files!

Many of the supported sites are widely used on the [Mobilism Forums](https://forum.mobilism.org/)

# Setup
1. Install [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/), [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or [GreaseMonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/)
2. Install the **SiteScrubber - All-in-One** script
3. PROFIT!!!!

**Suggest you also install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) as many of the supported sites are COVERED in Ads!**

# Features

 - Remove many unnecessary elements
 - Auto submit forms once CAPTCHA has been completed or once timer reaches 0
 - Automates clicks on page
 - Adds ability to hover over buttons to bypass clickjacking on invisible elements
 - Makes all supported sites in **DARK MODE** by force üòâ
