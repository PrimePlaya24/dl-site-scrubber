# dl-site-scrubber
Project intended to make QOL scripts to scrub a list of file-hosting sites downloading pages to make life simplier. 

SiteScrubber is specifically made for various download sites that have you wait a certain amount of time or click a button that is laid behind invisible blocks that intercept your click and take you to a different site. These scripts will help remove all the clutter and make the page simple to navigate and complete to download your requested files!
